# Code Demo  

### 1. Introduction  
Welcome to my demonstration repository. Here, you can find the best coding snippets for multiple tasks. I usually code in Python for data analysis and GIS. R is preferred for econometrics. I also use Jupyter notebooks for better commenting and I try to keep all my works as organized as I can. 

My [GitHub profile](https://github.com/HecVini) has multiple other examples of codes I have written since 2020.
### 2. Codes  

- **`mapbiomas_lulc_gis_tutorial.pdf`**  
A Python tutorial I prepered for Towards Data Science on (i) how to download MapBiomas Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) data with Google Earth Engine, (ii) subset it for a region, (iii) automate it to download for multiple years and (iv) make a beautiful map with the results.
  You can find the published tutorial [here](https://medium.com/towards-data-science/python-google-earth-engine-how-to-clean-mapbiomas-lulc-rasters-for-any-shapefile-in-brazil-05d13dcf2307). This code highlights my **GIS** and **technical writing** skills.

- **`panel_first_difference_estimation.ipynb`**  
  This R notebook contains the code I used in my master’s thesis to analyze how deforestation is contributing to increased droughts in the Pantanal region.  
  The code uses a panel dataset with LULC data for hydrographic basins over 39 years and (i) performs first-difference regressions, (ii) conducts multiple robustness checks and (iii) analyze heterogeneous effects.
  This shows my experience in **econometrics** and **data analysis**.

- **`era5_api.ipynb`** 
  A Python script that provides a step-by-step guide to querying Copernicus ERA5 wind and precipitation data. It starts by querying a single region and date, then automates the process for multiple regions and dates.  
  This code showcases my skills in working with APIs and handling NetCDF (multilayer raster) files.

- **`calzada_etal_replication.ipynb`**  
  This R notebook replicates the results from [Calzada, Meritxell, and Moscoso (2023)](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/725349?journalCode=jaere). The original paper was written in Stata and my replication (i) reproduces all tables from the paper, (ii) automates bootstrapping procedures and (iii) explain in detail the multiple estimation methods.  
  This project demonstrates my ability to understand **applied microeconomics papers** and **replicate advanced econometric methods**.

- **`dorling_map_elections2022.R`**  
  This R script creates a **cartogram visualizing Brazil's 2022 presidential election results. The cartogram solves the "land doesn’t vote" problem by scaling geographic regions according to the number of votes, showing regional voting margins proportionally.  
  I explained the main findings in [this X thread](https://x.com/hec_vini/status/1577553930837524481/photo/1). This project highlights my **data visualization skills** — making visually appealing charts is crucial for communicating research findings effectively.
